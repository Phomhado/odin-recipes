    <p>This is a delicious burguer! Burguers are the favorite food of many people
        <br>
       The combination of grilled cheese, the special sauces, tomatoes and onions, and of course, bacon, are a explosion in your mouth 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>To make a simple burguer, you should have:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Buns</li>
        <li>Beef or other types of meat</li>
        <li>Cheese (a lot of cheese)</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here are the step-by-step to make the burguer: (Remember, this is personal, you can try to mount your own burguers!)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the beef and put it in your BBQ or in a fry pan with 1 teaspoon of oil</li>
        <li>When the beef is medium-rare, put some cheese in top of it.</li>
        <li>Then, take a small lid, put some water close to the beef and rapidly close the burguer with the lid</li>
        <li>repeat the steps on how many beefs you want (I prefer 2 or 3)</li>
        <li>Put the bacon to fry and remove the burguers and cheese to another plate</li>
        <li>When the bacon is done, remove it and put the buns "face down" for a little</li>
        <li>Cut the onions and tomatoes and put it on top of the meat</li>
        <li>Finish with the sauces you want, like ketchup, mayo...</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That is how you make a smash burguer! Enjoy</p>
